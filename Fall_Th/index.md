## Course Description
An introduction to programming methodology including:  basic concepts of computer systems, the programming languages C/C++, algorithm design, program development, implementation, and testing.

## Online access
While all modules/assignments are accessible from this site, we will use [moodle](http://moodle.ramapo.edu/) to submit all programming assignments electronically.  **Please review the college's guide to online courses and moodle [here](http://www.ramapo.edu/summer/online/)**.

## About the hybrid version of this course
Hybrid courses substitute portions of regularly scheduled class time with online lectures.  This means that although this course is scheduled to meet for 210 minutes each week (6:00pm-9:30pm), **we will normally not**.  That also means you will need to be responsible and disciplined with keeping up with the video lectures I'll provide (below).  The video lectures in the class largely replace the in-class lectures (they are not **optional!**)

If you have never taken an hybrid course, you may be surprised how easy it is to fall behind.  When we meet in class, I will assume you've already viewed the assigned lectures online.  Most in-class meetings will be spent doing hands-on programming, using the concepts from the assigned video lectures.  I will be there to assist you, but it is your responsibility to have already digested and absorbed the material.    

Below I have explained the way the course is organized, and if anything is unclear please email me ASAP.  The number one thing to remember is that you need to keep pace with the content on moodle/this site, making sure that you master each week’s modules on a consistent basis.  Computer science, perhaps more than any other subject, builds from lesson to lesson.  There is no lesson/module that can be safely “skipped” - they will all come back to haunt you if you don’t understand them (or don’t try to learn them!).  **So please - keep up with the work**!.

### How to get help:
I will respond to emails very quickly, so whenever you are struggling with a concept, program, or anything else - please get in touch.  It is best to send me your code as an attachment with any email, so I can see precisely what you are doing.  I will also hold regular office hours on Monday and Thursday afternoons, 4-5pm.


## Co-Requisites

100 level General Education Math.

## Course Materials - Required Programs and Textbook
You must have access to the internet and a computer suitable for installing Microsoft Visual Studio (i.e. any computer running Microsoft Windows 7 or Windows 8).   Microsoft Visual Studio is freely available - please consult the directions/tuturial [located here](../vs/VisualStudioAtHome.html).

If you have a Mac, you will be able to install similar programs on these machines.  Instructions for using Xcode can be found [here](http://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/xcode/).  You may also use [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/cdt/).  

You are required to obtain a copy of the textbook for this course, which will be an extremely critical resource used throughout the semester.  The textbook can be purchased at the college bookstore, or easily online (click image link below):

# Course Structure

## Modules
The entire course has been broken into 30 individual modules.  Each module is posted as a slide show, and as a recorded video lecture (around 30-60 minutes in length each).  Each module will list, on the first slide, where in the textbook the topics discussed will be found.  You should approach each module as a set of resources - composed of the book chapter sections, the slides, the video, and the associated programming examples.  The textbook should be considered a required resource.

The listing below contains links to each module.  Moodle also contains these links, organized by the week's they are to be reviewed.

<p class="highlight">
It is your responsibility to view the Modules (and complete the assigned reading) on your own.  The schedule below outlines by which in-class meeting you are required to have complete the module for.  Viewing and reading through each module is NOT optional - they ARE THE LECTURES!

### Programming Examples
The majority of modules will include several programming examples.  The module’s video lecture will include a recording of the solution being developed.  Source code for solutions to the programming examples is also provided on appiversity (and below).  I highly recommend that you practice these examples without looking at the lecture videos or source code solutions as a method of preparing for the course’s exams.

All programming example source code from the modules is found in [Programming Examples.zip](../ProgrammingExamples.zip)

## Labs (In-Class)
Mosts weeks we will have an in-class lab session where you will be given a lab assignment to complete.  These labs are described in the lecture slides, and it is acceptable for you to work ahead if you wish, however your attendance at the in-class lab sessions are *mandatory*.

Each lab is designed to require roughly 45 minutes of programming time, but it varies greatly for each person, and for each assignment.  Each in-class lab session will start with a summary of what we've learned in the video modules, a question/answer session, and then you will complete the labs.  You are permitted to leave class as soon as you've shown me (and uploaded) your working lab code.

If you are unable to complete a lab before the end of class, you are permitted to complete it at home and to turn it in by 9am the following day.  **HOWEVER** you are not permitted to leave the lab session early, without completing the lab.  If you do, you will receive an automatic 0 for the lab.

Labs are meant to be an opportunity to ask questions, and for me to help you.  The goals is for you to complete them during the class session - utilizing as much help from me as you need - so please ask questions!

**No late labs will be accepted**.

Labs represent 10% of your semester grade, so each lab is actually only less than 1% of your overall grade.  Labs will be graded generously, and honest attempt at completing the problem will result in a 7 or 8 out of 10 points.  A working program will earn a 10/10.  The purpose of these labs is so I can review your progress each week and provide feedback to you.

## Recitations
In some of the in-class meetings, I will lecture for part of the entire session in addition to the lab time.  These are marked on the calendar below as "recitation".  Again, you are 100% expected to have worked though the specified modules for the given in-class meeting, recitations are scheduled so I can augment the modules, address common questions, and provide additional insights on the material.

# Meeting Calendar
The calendar below is subject to change - please make sure you read your emails!  Class will meet at 6:00pm on each Thursday during the semester, but most weeks we will only meet for approximately 1.5 hours.

<div style="margin:0px;padding:0px;overflow:hidden">

</div>


# Homework Assignments
There are four assigned homework problems, with due dates listed on moodle (and below).  Homework programs will likely require 3-6 hours of your time, and will be more involved and complex than your lab assignments.  I will provide more detailed feedback on homework, and grading will be more discerning.  Homework programs 20% of your semester grade, each being 5%.  Like labs, **no late homework will be accepted**.

Homework assignments must be uploaded to Moodle by 11:55pm on the evening it is due.  Moodle will shut off submissions at that time - so please leave yourself a few minutes in case your clock is off!

# Exams 
There will be 5 in-class programming quizzes throughout the semester, along with a final exam.  Exams are open book, open notes, and open internet.  They will involve live programming, similar to lab sessions. Some quizzes, along with the final exam, will contain some multiple choice/short answer questions as well.

You will have 70 minutes to complete all quizzes, and three hours to complete the final exam.

## Policy on Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

When completing lab programming exercises, you may review code with your fellow students; however, copying source code is strictly forbidden.  For homework programming assignments, you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.   If sharing of source code is suspected, intentional or otherwise, both parties will immediately be referred to the Office of the Provost.

# Students with Disabilities:
If you need course adaptation or accommodations because of a disability that has been documented with the Office of Specialized Services, please make an appointment during my office hours.
