## Course Description
An introduction to programming methodology including:  basic concepts of computer systems, the programming languages C/C++, algorithm design, program development, implementation, and testing.

## Online access
While all modules/assignments are accessible from this site, we will use [moodle](http://moodle.ramapo.edu/) to submit all programming assignments electronically.  **Please review the college's guide to online courses and moodle [here](http://www.ramapo.edu/summer/online/)**.

## About the online version of this course
If you have never taken an online course, you may be surprised how easy it is to fall behind.  Below I have explained the way the course is organized, and if anything is unclear please email me ASAP.  The number one thing to remember is that you need to keep pace with the content on moodle, making sure that you master each week’s modules on a consistent basis.  **Computer science, perhaps more than any other subject, builds from lesson to lesson**.  There is no lesson/module that can be safely “skipped” - they will all come back to haunt you if you don’t understand them (or don’t try to learn them!).  **So please - keep up with the work**!.

### How to get help:
I will respond to emails very quickly, so whenever you are struggling with a concept, program, or anything else - please get in touch.  It is best to send me your code as an attachment with any email, so I can see precisely what you are doing.  I will hold office hours by appointment, just email me and we'll work out a time to meet on campus.  We will also be able to video conference on Skype if needed.

## Co-Requisites
100 level General Education Math.

## Course Materials
You must have access to the internet and a computer suitable for installing Microsoft Visual Studio (i.e. any computer running Microsoft Windows 7 or Windows 8).   Microsoft Visual Studio is freely available - please consult the directions/tuturial [located here](../vs/VisualStudioAtHome.html).

If you have a Mac, you will be able to install similar programs on these machines.  Instructions for using Xcode can be found [here](http://pages.ramapo.edu/~sfrees/courses/xcode/).  You may also use [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/cdt/).  

You are required to obtain a copy of the textbook for this course, which will be an extremely critical resource
used throughout the semester.  The textbook can be purchased at the college bookstore, or easily online (click image link below):

## Modules
The entire course has been broken into 30 individual modules.  Each module is posted as a slide show, and as a recorded video lecture (around 30-60 minutes in length each).  Each module will list, on the first slide, where in the textbook the topics discussed will be found.  You should approach each module as a set of resources - composed of the book chapter sections, the slides, the video, and the associated programming examples.  The textbook should be considered a required resource.

## Programming Examples
The majority of modules will include several programming examples.  The module’s video lecture will include a recording of the solution being developed.  Source code for solutions to the programming examples is also provided on moodle (and below).  I highly recommend that you practice these examples without looking at the lecture videos or source code solutions as a method of preparing for the course’s exams.

All programming example source code from the modules is found in [Programming Examples.zip](../ProgrammingExamples.zip)

## Recommended Pace
I have organized moodle into 5 weeks, with each week containing several modules.  Programming example solutions are posted within the same week as the modules they are presented in.  It is critical that you keep pace with the course and complete the modules and labs during the week they are posted.  Lab assignments (roughly 3 per week) and Homework assignments (one per week) are due Friday or Saturday (see individual assignments below) evenings at 11:59pm.  No late work will be accepted, so please try to start the programs early.  

You may work ahead of the pace on moodle, and are encouraged to do so.  All contents is loaded onto moodle on the first day of class.  The pace set on moodle and above can be best thought of as your minimum pace.  

The Mid Term exam (see proctoring details below in exam section) will include up to and including Module 18.  The Final Exam will be comprehensive and include content from all Modules

# Course Assignments
You learn to program best by… programming a lot!  In this course I will be expecting you to write 3-4 programs each week of varying length.  These will be in the form of Labs and Homework programs.  You must submit all programs on moodle through the appropriate assignment links at the top of the course page.  It is imperative that you only submit the .cpp (source code) files when turning in your assignments.  I will build your programs and run them, so always triple check that you are submitting source code, and not some other Visual Studio related file (there are many!).  Note, in the first Module’s video, I will provided details instructions on how to get this right.

## Labs
At the end of some of the modules in the course is a dedicated slide with a Lab assignment described.  The labs are designed to require about 45 minutes of your time, and are best completed directly after the watching the previous video modules - as they reinforce the specific topics covered since the previous lab.  Labs should be turned in to moodle by the due date listed in the table above.  **No late labs will be accepted**.

Labs represent 10% of your semester grade, so each lab is actually only less than 1% of your overall grade.  Labs will be graded generously, and honest attempt at completing the problem will result in a 7 or 8 out of 10 points.  A working program will earn a 10/10.  The purpose of these labs is so I can review your progress each week and provide feedback to you.  Please make every attempt to complete each on by the assigned due date.

## Homework
There are four assigned homework problems, with due dates listed on moodle (and below).  Homework programs will likely require 3-6 hours of your time, and will be more involved and complex than your lab assignments.  I will provide more detailed feedback on homework, and grading will be more discerning.  Homework programs 20% of your semester grade, each being 5%.  Like labs, no late homework will be accepted.

## Exams (Mid Term and Final)
Midterm and Final Exams will be proctored, **meaning you will be required to come to campus twice during the five week semester**.  Special accommodations/waivers for this policy will be made on a case-by-case basis, typically for students who attend other institutions as their primary degree-granting school or Ramapo students who live beyond reasonable commuting distance (~1 hour) from campus.  **This must be negotiated with the instructor before July 10th**.  

Mid-Term exam will July 21th, and the final exam will be held on August 8th.  Exam proctoring will be scheduled with every attempt to accommodate student schedules, including a night session to allow working students to attend.  The exams will last 3 hours each.

|  | Modules Covered | Date
|--|---|---
| **Mid Term Exam** | Modules 1-18 | Tuesday, 7/21/2015 (9am or 6pm)
| **Final Exam** | Modules 19-30 | Thursday, 8/06/2015 (9am or 6pm)

You will be required to let me know in advance which session (9am or 6pm) you intend to attend.

## Policy on Academic Integrity
Students are expected to read and understand Ramapo College’s Academic Integrity Policy, which can be found in the Ramapo College Catalog.  Members of the Ramapo College community are expected to be honest and forthright in their academic endeavors.  Students who are suspected of violating this policy will be referred to the Office of the Provost.

When completing lab programming exercises, you may review code with your fellow students; however, copying source code is strictly forbidden.  For homework programming assignments, you may discuss ideas, however you may not allow others to see your source code or examine others’.  Sharing of source code is extremely easy to detect and is strictly prohibited.   If sharing of source code is suspected, intentional or otherwise, both parties will immediately be referred to the Office of the Provost.

# Students with Disabilities:
If you need course adaptation or accommodations because of a disability that has been documented with the Office of Specialized Services, please make an appointment during my office hours.
